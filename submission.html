          Paper registration is required for inclusion in the conference

          paper or poster. This is a requirement for publication in the ACM

            Each paper will be double-blindly reviewed by at least three

            Conference”. Please adhere to this requirement when you prepare for
            your paper. Double-blindly means that the author of a paper does not
            know the reviewers of his/her paper and reviewers do not know the
            authors of the papers they reviewed.

            Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
            violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be

            a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.
            We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper
            attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name
            normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

          🔓 Important Update: ACM Open Access Publishing Model (2026)
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Starting <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, ACM will fully transition
          to <strong>Open Access</strong>. All ACM publications, including those
          from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be
          <strong>100% Open Access</strong>. Authors will have two primary
          options for publishing Open Access articles: participation in the ACM
          Open institutional model or payment of Article Processing Charges
          (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM Open, the
          majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from
          authors or conferences (currently, around 70–75%). Authors from
          institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC,
          unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To check
          whether an APC applies to your paper, please consult the list of
          participating institutions and review the APC Waivers and Discounts
          Policy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          ACM understands this transition may pose financial challenges. To
          help, ACM has approved a <strong>temporary subsidy</strong> for 2026:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
          <li><strong>$250 APC</strong> for ACM/SIG members</li>
          <li><strong>$350 APC</strong> for non-members</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This represents a <strong>65% discount</strong>, funded directly by
          ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to
          join ACM Open. This temporary pricing applies to all conferences
          scheduled for 2026.
